    <p><b>Hong Kong - A Ghost Town</b></a></p>

		<p>The political warfare in Hong Kong had disrupted much of society and had negatively impacted almost all industries but namely food and beverage, hospitality, and tourism. The city formerly known to house the leading dining scene in Asia was stripped of its identity.
		</br>
    </br>
    Hong Kong’s economy was getting more and more disastrous, with people praying daily that rock bottom had already passed. Everyone <i>living</i> in HK, <i>owning</i> businesses in HK, <i>conducting</i> business with HK partners, or merely those who have booked vacations to <i>visit</i> HK, were all praying for a miracle - a change of course in what seemed like a very long foreseeable future. There was a taunting realization in everyone’s minds when we all realized that this was not ending any time soon, this presumption left the city stagnant. Businesses were unable to expand and grow as initially planned, store and restaurant openings were halted, events and festivals were forced to be postponed - and ultimately cancelled. 
    </br>
    </br>
    The unrest that the city had faced in the few months that felt like forever, had brought people together but also tore many apart. People with different ideologies were in constant disagreement, causing discord amongst families, couples, friends, peers, and even strangers. The protests became unpredictable and unsafe, those who were not out marching the streets, were taking cover at home. People were no longer dining out, walking around, and shopping on the once famously coined to be the hustle and bustle of streets of Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s economy was experiencing the darkest days it has seen in the past decade, companies had to slowly lay off workers and eventually most had to forego and close down. This went on for months and the turmoil eventually became fear. Fear that <i>this</i> is now the lives we will be living indefinitely, fear that Hong Kong will never be the same as it was before, fear that Hong Kong’s strong foothold in the global economy is now a thing of its past, and last but not least fear of the safety of our children and elderly.
    </br>
    </br>
    As the months passed, the gravity of the situation became increasingly significant. The war between the yellows, blues, blacks and whites became life threatening and instilled trepidation. The majority treated this as a war while many others were watching helplessly on the sidelines hoping for the mayhem to pass. The city had transformed and seven months later, it was undeniably unrecognizable. To our dismay, when the situation seemed like it couldn’t get any worse, in reality it was only the beginning of a downward spiral. By the seventh month of chaos, news about COVID-19 was slowly seeping into the frenzied city. The global pandemic had hit Hong Kong at an absolute turbulent time and struck the city unapologetically. The already quiet streets became <i>ghostly</i>. Experiences outside of homes were almost nonexistent. Industries such as hospitality, food and beverage, and tourism were taking on a second wave of shock while still acclimatizing to the shift in the economical standstill caused by the protests. COVID-19 was unlike any other pandemic. More deadly and with a greater sweeping reach, it was killing people by the masses. Hong Kong, the first city to be hit outside of mainland China was unprepared to say the least.
    </br>
    </br>
    News on this new disease was spreading like wildfire, but this was nothing remarkable. In the past months, Hong Kong has been more connected than ever with updates of protests from all sides, on all media platforms. From forwarded WhatsApp announcements, telegram groups, facebook groups, reddit posts, newspaper publications, television segments, youtube videos, etc. people were reading and hearing at least 20 updates each day from those around them. Videos of infected individuals fainting on crowded streets, subway stations, malls and other public spaces created an instant city wide frantic reaction. The chilling characteristic of COVID-19 specifies that its incubation period can last up to 14 days. This suggests that symptoms may not show up on an infected individual, however they may be carriers of the fatal disease. Although not air-borne, the COVID-19 germs can last on surfaces for hours which can result in human to human transmission through objects.

    By mid January 2020, 3M masks, N95 respiratory masks, hand sanitizers, and wet wipes were all immediately sold out of stock. Not long after, tissue paper, rice, and hygiene products were all flying off shelves as families started purchasing in bulk, creating a mass shortage in stores as the sudden demand was less than expected. Schools were closing, offices were requesting employees to work from home, travel bans were being instilled, institutional exams were being postponed and cancelled, the city was at a complete halt. No one had answers, and the government was being criticized left and right for its poor approach in handling the protests and the global pandemic. Laws lasting up to 2 weeks were implemented to encourage social distancing. Soon, the 2 weeks became a month, a month became 2, 2 became 3, and 3 became indefinitely. 
    </br>
    </br>
    As I am writing this today, (April 4th 2020) bars, gyms, clubhouses and leisure venues such as karaoke chains, mahjong houses, and cinemas are all forced to close for two weeks. Laws against groups of more than 4 people in public spaces are applied, travelers entering the city from foreign countries must adhere to quarantine rules. Any misbehavior in the above regulations will result in fines and prison time. At this point, it has become a global pandemic with countries such as America, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, China, Iran, and the UK at the forefront of this crisis yet it is not expected to be conclude any time soon. With a predicted peak to be mid April, which is currently unfathomable as we are already in such an extreme and jarring recession, the outcome will definitely consist of far more losers than winners. For those only graduating this Spring, the saturated market is an obstacle in which they will have many disadvantages in. With no current income, no experience, an immense amount of competition, and lastly with employers that have less of an ability to hire, entering the market now will be a difficult hurdle to overcome.
    </br>
    </br>
    As the economic infrastructure of Hong Kong shifted dramatically from month to month we handled unpredicted situations thrown our way. It is unfortunate to see the city demolish is such a vast speed. We can only do our part and stay at home as much as we can, abstain from temptation to violate the implemented laws, and spread awareness to those who do not comprehend the sheer magnitude of the situation.</p>
